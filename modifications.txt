We list here the modifications that we made to Polly while building Loopy and the affected/added source files:

1. A pass named PiecewiseAffineTransform has been added to the set of transformations. 
   - lib/Transform/PiecewiseAffineTransform.cpp

2. We built a parser to read in the transformation script.
   - include/polly/OptParser.h
   - lib/OptParser/

3. We modified Polly's scop detection procedure to generate canonical schedules and extract loop-components from the source file.
   - include/ScopInfo.h 
   --- declared LoopDomainMap and printLoopDomainMap()

   - lib/Analysis/ScopInfo.cpp 
   --- modified Scop::Scop() and Scop::buildScop() functions to also construct LoopDomainMap
   --- commented out dropConstantScheduleDims() in Scop::buildScop() to get a canonical schedule representation

4. We required two functions isl_set_sum and isl_map_sum from ISL. These functions were supported by ISL, but hidden from outside world. We changed their visibility.
   - lib/External/isl/include/isl/map.h
